Problem statement
You have been given an array/list ‘arr’ of integers consisting of ‘n’ integers which are the weight of ‘n’ balls. Your task is to return the size of the smallest subset of balls whose weight is greater than the weight of the remaining balls.

Example:
You have 3 balls of weight 1, 2, and 3. You can take subset (1, 3) or (2, 3) as their total weight is greater than the weight of the remaining balls. The answer will be 2.

Green balls are taken in a subset.
Note:
You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= ‘arr[i]’ <= 10^6

Where ‘T’ is the number of test cases.‘N’ is the number of elements in the array/list. ‘arr[i]’ is the weight of the ith ball.

Sample Output 1 Explanation:
Test case1:

All the possible subsets are:-
{1} → Total weight of balls in subset 1.Sum of weights of remaining balls 2.It is an invalid subset since the weight of balls in the subset is not greater than the weight of the remaining balls.
{2} → Total weight of balls in subset 2.Sum of weights of remaining balls 1. It is a valid subset since the weight of balls in the subset is greater than the weight of the remaining balls.
{1,2} → Total weight of balls in subset 3.Sum of weights of remaining balls 0.It is a valid subset since the weight of balls in the subset is greater than the weight of the remaining balls.

Therefore the minimum subset size is 1.

Test case 2:

All the possible subsets are:-
{1} → Total weight of balls in subset 1.Sum of weights of remaining balls 1.It is an invalid subset since the weight of balls in the subset is not greater than the weight of the remaining balls.
{1,1} → Total weight of balls in subset 2.Sum of weights of remaining balls 0.It is a valid subset since the weight of balls in the subset is greater than the weight of the remaining balls.

Therefore the minimum subset size is 2.

     ans++;
	 curSum+=arr[i];
	 if (curSum>sum/2) return ans;

// subset_sum > S−subset_sum

// Simplifying this inequality:

// subset_sum >𝑆/2
